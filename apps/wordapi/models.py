""" Word API Data models

    For Django fc_coding_challenge - wordapi app.

    - This model exist for querying words, across lanaugages/dictionaries, via API.
    - The intended usecase of this model and API is to find word-matches to substring user-queries, and anagrams of those matching words.
    - Alphagrams are used here to assocate words in data that are anagrams to each other.
    - All words that are anagrams of one another will also share the same alphagramâ€“ the string resulting from sorting a word/string's letters/characters alphabetically.  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alphagram
